## Application & Game Object <br />
- Challenge: How can different Game Objects move with different Input Systems? <br />

Option 1: Using Function Pointers / std::function <br />
- Very simple, easy to assign Lamdas, free functions, or member functions
- Great for "data-driven" behavior <br />

Option 2: Using Inheritance / State Pattern <br />
